I thought I’d make my first real blog post about something cool I came across while perusing Facebook. While I was scrolling through my news feed, I saw that the Wikipedia page shared their article on “Happiness”, saying “Scientists can measure anything they put their minds to. Here's a short list of methods used to measure happiness”. This was intriguing enough, so I began reading, and was not disappointed. In this post, I’m going to discuss “flow”.



So yeah, there’s a psychological phenomenon called “flow”, coined by Hungarian psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (and people say my last name’s hard to pronounce). We actually experience “flow” all the time- it’s “the zone”, when you’re so absorbed in something that you lose sense of your surroundings. To Csikszentmihalyi, flow is a sort of transcendant state beyond happiness- that is to say, you’re not really happy when you experience it, but you are cognizant of its positive effect on your happiness after the fact. In fact, he talks about six factors that’re key to realizing flow, which are summarized [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224927532_Flow_The_Psychology_of_Optimal_Experience):


  * There are clear goals every stop of the way
  * There is immediate feedback to one's actions
  * Action and awareness are merged
  * There is no worry of failure
  * Distractions are excluded from consciousness
  * Self-consciousness disappears
  * The activity becomes autotelic
  * The sense of time becomes distorted



According to Wikipedia, Csikszentmihalyi got interested in this idea of “flow” while studying artists, who were so engrossed in painting that they disregarded basic necessities like food, water, and sleep. The criteria listed above must be felt together in order to realize “flow”, and some of them are more obvious than others- we’ve all felt at least some of them at one time or another. However, several of the criteria stand out from being merely focused on one’s activity, at least to me.


First, the merger of action and awareness is interesting. My analogy to this is watching a soccer player dribble- his instinct guides his movement. Anyone who plays soccer, or another sport, will understand that element of instinct- you don’t plan or think about what you’re doing, you just do it. It’s weird to think of doing that during a problem set, but I can see how that applies to people who’re true masters of what they do, such as (some of the) professors I’ve had. There’s a quality of effortlessness that sets them apart from their peers, like watching Yo-Yo Ma play the cello or Kyrie Irving handling a basketball. Sure, solving a circuit isn’t quite as flashy, but the element is there- total comfort, deeper instinct, whatever you want to attribute it to.

Another one is the worry of failure. It’s a hard one to achieve- we often have people depending on us to complete a task, and practical concerns take precedence over desires in many cases, perhaps rightfully so. It is still remarkable that achieving a flow experience requires this lack of worry, because it’s perhaps the most difficult thing to achieve for many, especially if the activity in question is professional. It is clear, then, that achieving flow requires a confidence that dominates any fear, which is something interesting to consider. I theorize this ties into the action and awareness- being confident in your ability to solve or complete the task at hand allows you to lose that sense of awareness.


Lastly, the autotelic criterion is fascinating. For someone to do something with an autotelic personality means that the person is doing it solely for some inner sense of purpose which may be strongly correlated to curiosity. This is in contrast to external factors, including fame, money, or power. To me, this is a challenge of the real motivations behind my choices. Do I study AI because it’s the cool thing to do now? Am I an engineer to find the safest, most prestigious, or highest-paying jobs? To be honest, it’s hard to say- I think I’ve found some near-flow experiences doing work sometimes, engineering work that’s made me happy even through the pressure associated with school. But regardless, I think it’s an important introspection everyone should try to make.




I’m not a psychologist, of course, but it makes sense to me that flow could be so essential to being happy. I think the most blissful and serene moments for me are when I’m only focused on one thing, and that the property of flow to transcend the temporal state makes it so powerful. As you grow up, responsibilities and deadlines can be such a burden- that’s probably why the mindfulness movement has gained so much attention. The fact that flow is so integral to the creative process presents a revelation that is not shocking but still necessary to highlight- that to achieve real happiness, people need to do what they love. As a disclaimer, I want to say that in all likelihood, my assertion that doing something you genuinely love maximizes “flow”, thereby maximizing happiness, may be naive and assuming- I’ve never taken a psychology class. Nonetheless, it’s a strong statement for people who’re seeking motivation or guidance- with the right dedication, stimulating your creative faculty towards something you love is a path to self-actualization over, perhaps, immediate rewards in a less engaging activity. And if you can’t feel “flow” in what you’re doing now, maybe it’s not a bad idea to reconsider.
