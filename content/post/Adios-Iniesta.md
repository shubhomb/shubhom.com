Ahead of his final match in a Barca shirt, a tribute to a player who delivered some of the most incredible moments of my childhood as a soccer fan.


So many moments of unmatched class and brilliance.


...THAT goal against Chelsea in 2009...


...and an unforgettable World Cup final goal in 2010, paying tribute to the late Dani Jarque.


A champion I had the privilege of watching every week growing up.


Gracias Andr√©s :smile:
