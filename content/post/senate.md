## A Big Deal

The most recent election has at once been incredibly disheartening, incredibly relieving, and incredibly exhausting for a lot of people. Yet due to a variety of factors, the state of American government is still far from certain. As you may know, I am from Georgia, the state which incredibly swung blue for Joe Biden and is going to not one but two Senate runoff races that determine whether the next US government is characterized by gridlock or progress. In this political climate, I feel compelled to share some thoughts and encourage you to partake in what is an often frustrating and sometimes distant political process but something I feel is crucial at this moment, especially given the absurdly thin margins Georgia saw in the presidential race. If you care about any issue at all, whether you're from here or not, what happens in Georgia over the next several weeks can have a great impact in your day-to-day life: decisions about COVID-19 relief, criminal justice, climate change, and more hinge upon these runoffs. If none of that sways you, here are some other reasons I will try to personally sway you to contribute to the Georgia cause:

- my birthday is coming up

- the holiday season, also, is coming up

## Personal Merits
I think it'd be unfair to write this without trying to demonstrate that the candidates Georgia Democrats have put forth have some merit over their opposition. While no candidates are perfect and political ideas are by nature difficult to agree on, I believe Georgia Democrats have presented two candidates who have both exhibited a high degree of character and have few negative personal characteristics. For this exercise, I'm going to purposefully avoid any policy arguments, because it's quite similar to the Presidential election- the biggest con of all may be that both of the Republican candidates are among Trump's greatest allies in the Senate, and the Democratic candidates are the only options in this race for any kind of progressive, liberal, or anti-Trump conservative attitude. I not only disagree with the Republican candidates in their policies, but also find myself alarmed they would [go to the extent of delegitimizing the Georgia election process](https://www.ajc.com/opinion/opinion-ga-doesnt-need-baseless-accusations/3ZRQMFOACNHCLPCMDBZZCOQYM4/). I spent several hours trying to find non-policy pros and cons of each person, and the rest of this section is discussing those.

My goal here is to look at their other qualities they present, and I'll structure this as a list of pros and cons of each candidate, that I've found via Wikipedia and other sources (cited if they're not from Wikipedia). Keep in mind that you can fact check these yourself if you're not convinced: I'm happy to change this if something is incorrect or not fairly covered.


### Jon Ossoff


#### Pros:
- CEO Insight TWI, a investigative journalism company that made films about human rights and the ebola outbreak, among other things.
- interned for John Lewis in high school. Even if he got John Lewis coffee *once* that's a cool connection.


#### Cons:
- Accused of being privileged in background: this may be true, he went to a pretty expensive private school nearby called Paideia.


### David Purdue


#### Pros:
- As an exec at Reebok and Dollar General, he did a good job revitalizing business for both


#### Cons:
- 7th richest Senator
- Traded on [private COVID-19 information](https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/david-perdue-stock-trading-saw-uptick-coronavirus-took-hold/MRWmzwXeHgxi6IcmBbPgaN/). He said financials planners did it on his behalf.
- Ran an antisemitic ad against Jon Ossoff (see the ad [here](https://forward.com/news/national/451581/jon-ossoff-jewish-nose-david-perdue-antisemitic/))
- ["Kah-mah-la or Kah-ma-la or Kamamboamamla"](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/16/david-perdue-mocks-kamala-harris-name-429996)  mocking VP-elect Kamala Harris's name which he certainly must have known how to pronounce after working with her in the Senate for years
- Skipped debate with Jon Ossoff to [go to a Trump rally ](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/523500-georgia-senator-to-skip-debate-after-democratic-rival-goes-viral)


### Raphel Warnock


#### Pros:
- grew up in Savannah's housing projects
- head pastor at Ebenezer Baptist Church, where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was also head pastor
- arrested in 2002 for [protecting children from being questioned by police](https://www.ajc.com/politics/politics-blog/republicans-raise-warnocks-2002-arrest-as-senate-runoffs-heat-up/S6IE4QX5ERCLVP3IKBSUVMNIC4/)
- arrested in 2014 for [protesting the repeal of the Affordable Care Act](https://www.ajc.com/news/ebenezer-rev-raphael-warnock-arrested-during-capitol-protest/dApzGUStARSGGAm2KB2fzI/)
- [Teamed up with 2 Chainz and TI](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/01/us/politics/raphael-warnock-ga.html) on social justice initiatives
- on the record saying [he loves puppies](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/raphael-warnock-puppies-ad-kelly-loeffler_n_5fa53378c5b660095698eed7)

#### Cons:
- may have [ran over his wife's foot](https://www.ajc.com/news/local-govt--politics/warnock-wife-involved-dispute/MCQYpvtswlZIIGdItrfcBJ/), apparently accidentally



### Kelly Loeffler


#### Pros:
- Has a cool trajectory from farm work to businesswoman
- CEO of a company that does stuff with Bitcoin
- co-owner of WNBA Atlanta Dream and [advocates women's empowerment in the workplace](https://www.ajc.com/sports/risk-hoops-memories-entice-new-dream-owner-loeffler/WDPsGpIV66px3SsHgkA7FP/)


#### Cons:
- the company she was CEO of is owned/founded by her husband who also is chairman of the New York Stock Exchange
- the Atlanta Dream [support Warnock a lot more ](https://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/more-sports/wnba-players-endorsed-the-opponent-of-atlanta-dream-co-owner-kelly-loeffler-to-help-force-a-runoff-for-georgia-s-senate-seat/ar-BB1aLy7j) in large part due to Loeffler's anti-BLM stance
- Richest senator: #1 in the Senate with estimated wealth around $500 million.
- 100% voting record with Trump. Policy-based I guess, but 100% agreement with anyone is suspicious...


Being rich or privileged doesn't, to me, make someone automatically unqualified for office per se, but I wanted to list that as a "con" because if one is (justifiably) very concerned that the great privilege enjoyed by government officials is not representative of their constituencies, then this discrepancy can indeed be presented as a "con". I do agree that it's troubling Congresspersons are so much more wealthier than average people, it certainly adds to the sense of detachment that the average voter might feel. It's also worth mention that prominent Democratic senators like Mark Warner and Dianne Feinstein are among the richest members of the Senate, having amassed a net worth larger than Purdue's. The main reason I included that information is that concerns over Ossoff's privilege are incomplete without weighing Loeffler and Purdue's privilege as well.


Regarding both Loeffler and Purdue profiting from COVID-19 information, I also acknowledge that a Democrat, Dianne Feinstein was also [being investigated for similar actions](https://www.npr.org/2020/05/26/862692569/justice-department-closes-investigations-of-3-senators-burr-inquiry-continues]). Because the Department of Justice itself is kind of compromised in the Trump administration, it's difficult to ascertain the truth. To me, it's most frustrating that despite possibly even profiting from the situation, purposefully or not, both Georgia Senators chose to enable Trumpian tactics of downplaying the virus and misleading the public about it. In a similar vein, they chose to follow Trump's baseless election fraud accusations against *Republican* Georgia elections officials. Democrat or Republican, evidence and truth can't be molded by political agendas- reality can't be contorted by mere words.


## The Odds
The unique Georgia runoff election is a second shot for Warnock and Ossoff to win their elections outright. Thankfully, elections are a dynamic process- while betting odds favored Republicans before the November election, Biden's win in Georgia, albeit within a recount margin, [should give Democrats confidence](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/09/ossoff-georgia-democrats-senate-435305) about flipping Georgia's seats. Furthermore, the infrastructure to increase voter turnout has proven remarkably successful in recent years, which gives me optimism that the same forces can mobilize voters this time as well.



Polling numbers [show a tight race](https://www.ajc.com/politics/politics-blog/an-early-poll-of-georgias-twin-senate-runoffs-shows-tight-races/DUDDDLIHCJH4LORTT57HAOUG64/). Loeffler leads Warnock 49%-48% with a 2.6% margin of error and 3% undecided in the first poll released after the national election. However, [several polls prior to the election](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/georgias-runoffs-will-determine-control-of-the-senate-heres-what-we-know-so-far/) consistently showed Warnock leading Loeffler. In the other race, Perdue has a 50%-46% lead on Ossoff with 4% undecided. Polls are an imperfect prediction of voter behavior, but all indications are that securing high turnout is an absolute necessity for Democratic victory.



## Things to Do
First, for friends that are in Georgia, please go vote if you're eligible and convince your other friends too as well. The assumption about runoff elections is that they're catered towards "base voters", but even if you don't consider yourself part of a "base", the consequences are enough that you should show
up. Unsure if you're registered? Visit [vote.org](https://www.vote.org/am-i-registered-to-vote/). The deadline to register is [December 7](https://sos.ga.gov/admin/files/2020%20Revised%20Short%20Calendar.pdf). Need to register or don't know where to vote? Check out the [Georgia voter page](https://www.mvp.sos.ga.gov/MVP/mvp.do). Need an absentee ballot? Here's [how to get one](https://georgia.gov/vote-absentee-ballot). If you're thinking about it and can set aside some time, sign up to phone bank, text bank, be a poll worker, or go canvassing safely.


I encourage everyone who legally and financially is able to [donate](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/georgiasenate). This is important even if you're not from here because [a large portion of both Democrat candidates' fundraising comes from out-of-state and small donors](https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2020/11/georgia-senate-runoffs-spending-continues/). Here are some places that could use your money:


- [Win Both Seats](https://www.winbothseats.org/)  allows your donation to go towards several Georgia voting orgnizers (including Fair Fight and New Georgia Project)
- [Fair Fight signup page](https://fairfight.com/join-our-fight/)
- [New Georgia Project](https://newgeorgiaproject.org/)
- [Ossoff campaign page](https://go.electjon.com/page/s/web-volunteer)
- [Warnock campaign page](https://warnockforgeorgia.com/take-action/)
