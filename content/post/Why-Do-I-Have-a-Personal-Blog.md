To begin with, I want to say that it feels a bit conceited to create this, but I thought it'd be a fun avenue for sharing my thoughts without anybody being forced to read as is the case in social media. Because let's be real, nobody's going to read a 5 paragraph movie critique on their news feed, but in a blog the writer is free to express themselves and the reader makes a conscious choice to visit the blog. This is a way to give perhaps more personal and idiosyncratic insights, especially with my interests, like a diary open to whoever wants to see it.


Welcome!
