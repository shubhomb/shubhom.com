One of the books I read this summer was Barack Obama's 2nd novel *The Audacity of Hope: Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream*, which was published in late 2006. In his characteristically flowery but comprehensible language, the then-Senator vividly breaks down his ideas on contemporary issues in and out of the political arena drawing upon anecdotal evidence as well as a litany of researched statistics. In my opinion, the novel is much more than a mere political manifesto- though he discusses political plans of action extensively, he is vocal about his own biases and the possibility of better alternatives. Additionally, Obama's incorporation of personal experiences such as his spiritual awakening provide a context for readers to understand his viewpoints. It was incredible as a reader in 2018 to see how many of Obama's thoughts on issues in 2006 are now intertwined with the legacy of his administration. Similarly, it was remarkable how his amenable behavior contrasted with the divisive and confrontational attitudes that prevail today on both sides. Even if one disagrees with every policy the Obama administration enforced, this book is a fascinating and uniquely personal glimpse not just into Obama but also the dynamics of American politics in modern times. Indeed, the most fascinating theme of the novel for me was his unbridled optimism- that through it all, he genuinely believes American can fix its problems, a message he continues to spread. In other words, it was inspiring to see someone who had faced adversity and negativity in his personal life and  political career continue to believe in his core values and those of a nation to eventually become the President of the United States of America.


Obama's book consists of a prologue and 9 chapters. I'm going to talk about what stood out to me the most, because his thoughts on policy are of course very public and no policy analysis I can write after reading one book is sufficiently nuanced to be meaningful. As was one of Obama's goals in writing the book, I think the value of such an exercise on my part comes mainly by fostering a discourse in which people can realize that ultimately, we all have a lot more in common than we ever care to believe or choose to acknowledge.




## Prologue:


In the prologue of the book, one thing that stood out was Obama's recollections of a "chronic restlessness; an inability to appreciate... those blessings that were right in front of [him]". He describes his despair as a state legislator unable to influence the major issues in national policy while watching junior politicians advance their careers. Then, Obama talks about his maturation from such pessimism towards an appreciation for those things he previously took for granted, to some extent, such as his family. He also talks about accepting his limits, that perhaps his career would not progress beyond that position as a state legislator, and have to secure his financial future. In this context, he decides with his wife that he will run for the US Senate as a "make or break" moment. In the Senate race Obama describes a freedom due to low expectations, as a state legislator with no particular advantage over his 5 opponents. He takes energy from this liberation, and sets out to gain endorsements and meet the Illinois electorate with a young and small staff. Obama holds "press conferences to which nobody [comes]]" and makes hours-long trips to "find just two or three people waiting for [him] around a kitchen table". However, through meeting citizens, Obama realizes one overarching truth- "just how modest people's hopes [are], and how much of what they believe [seem] to hold constant across race, region, religion and class."


## Chapter 1: Republicans and Democrats


Chapter 1 discusses some of Obama's experiences as a Congressman. He mentions that facing the wrath of the media is not as bad as people think- that he doesn't take Fox News seriously because he knows their programs are constructed for media revenue, and that being called names is not nearly as bad as political imprisonment like "Mandela [or] Solzhenitsyn". As a new Senator, he notices the cordiality of the older Senators which contrasts with the general atmosphere, a result of a more partisan political system. Obama highlights the rise of zealotry in politics, contributing to party platforms and packaged ideologies that serve to represent few Americans in the end.  

## Chapter 2: Values


Chapter 2 for me was one of the most unforgettable parts of the entire book. Obama is unique as a liberal American politician in acknowledging the importance of values, such as those that avoid instant gratification and materialism, and those that are the foundation of our sense of justice. Empathy, for example, is a common value that most people would like to exhibit themselves and see in others. Yet, Obama sees a lack of empathy and perspective in the American sociopolitical scene. In this "call to find common ground", among other examples, Obama urges black leaders to understand that white labor unions have legitimate concerns about affirmative action, points out that CEOs should not cut employees' health plans while raising their own bonuses, and that Obama himself should be obligated to see through George Bush's eyes despite their ideological disparities. While Obama is pragmatic about the reality of 21st century America, he challenges Americans to remember their values, such as those that form healthy families and those that promote equal opportunity, which are almost universal, transcendant of race, wealth, party affiliation, or any other factor. Whether the government directly enforces them or not, such values are crucial to the betterment of American society in Obama's opinion.


## Chapter 3: Our Constitution


Obama in this chapter talks about the mechanism of the Constitution to be more than an absolute set of rules. He argues that the success of America as a democracy is a product of the Founding Fathers' recognition of changeability. The explicit powers and functions of government are relatively small and in some instances vague. Obama cites James Madison in arguing that the debating of policy allows for solutions that work best for the majority of the people.
