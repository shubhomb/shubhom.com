The most rewarding part of my job for the last two years has been the opportunity to work with blind patients. My patients are people who have lost their sight well into their adult years, sometimes unexpectedly. Needless to say, the lessons they have imparted upon me through the trial have helped me grow as a person and scientist. Here, I'd like to share some of those.

When embarking upon a clinical trial, the scientist(s) responsible must define eligibility criteria for participation. These aren't necessarily set in stone from the beginning (Stage I- safety evaluation) to the end (coming to market) of a clinical trial [*check*]. I don't have a general statement to make about how these participants are recruited- for our clinical trial, foundations affiliated with us and word-of-mouth seem to have been the two biggest contributors, and I figure that being located in New York has made us accessible to a larger patient pool. Prospective patients who are interested in joining the trial are screened, and if they are eligible and compliant with the protocol (meaning that they agree to be tested at scheduled periods over the course of the study), they enter the trial and receive treatment.

Here, I'd like to point out that clinical trials are *experimental*. The subjects who agree to be in them are volunteers who are often motivated to risk personal safety for a few reasons- things like a lack of alternative options, a concern for family or peers, and a desire to advance science. I wouldn't have really thought about this before working in this field, so it's important to acknowledge the sacrifices families may have to make.
