abstract = "This survey selects several model-free and model-based techniques and evaluate their relative strengths and weaknesses on the Acrobot task. While this is not indicative of these algorithmsâ€™ performance on continuous state-space control problems in general or exhaustive of the techniques available, the ultimate goal is to produce a finding about the importance of learning a model."
