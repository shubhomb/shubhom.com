abstract = "Soft robots utilize deformable materials for actuation. As a result, rigid body modeling fails to characterize
soft robot motion, especially with greater degrees of freedom. Inspired by the biological faculty of proprioception, we propose
treating this problem as a machine learning problem for sensing the robot’s own movement. Specifically, we test this approach
on a robotic arm that is composed of a mesh of optical lightguides. After trialing several different supervised regression
algorithms, we find that using artificial neural networks (ANNs) empirically yields the lowest metric regression error and is able to successfully predict the arm’s motion. Further work is planned to assess the learned model’s performance on robots with additional degrees of freedom."
