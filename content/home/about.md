# Biography

Welcome to my site!I'm a junior at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. I grew up in metro-Atlanta and went to Alpharetta High School, located in suburban Atlanta. Right now, I'm looking at majoring in Electrical & Computer Engineering and Computer Science, with the ambition of applying novel machine learning algorithms and techniques to the real world. This site was a personal project that began the summer after my senior year in high school, as a way to explore web design in a functional and creative way. My goal is to share what I'm working on periodically as I work on new things. Take a look around and contact me if you have questions, concerns, or want to discuss anything!
