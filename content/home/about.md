# Hey!
## Welcome to my website.
I work with computer vision at [Nirenberg Neuroscience] (https://nirenbergneuroscience.com/) in New York, New York. I like to think about new ways to responsibly leverage the immense capabilities artificial intelligence provides, including the social and environmental issues we face today. As part of that, I also work with [Greenstand](https://greenstand.org/home) on a variety of machine learning problems.  

Outside of work, I'm a huge soccer and basketball fan and enjoy spending time with my friends and family. In creating this site, my goal is to share a bit about myself and the things I'm working on periodically. Take a look around and feel free to get in touch!
