# Hey!
## Welcome to my website.
I'm a junior at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. I was born and raised in metro-Atlanta. Currently, I'm majoring in Electrical & Computer Engineering and Computer Science with the intention of finding new ways to leverage the immense capabilities artificial intelligence provides. Outside of work, I'm a huge soccer fan and enjoy spending time with my friends and family. In creating this site, my goal is to share a bit about myself and the things I'm working on periodically. Take a look around and feel free to contact me if you have questions, concerns, or want to discuss anything!
