# Hello!
Welcome to my site! I'm an engineer at [Bionic Sight](https://www.bionicsightllc.com/) in New York City. My focus is currently on a novel optogenetic prosthetic treatment, called BS01, where I use research of the retina's neural code to restore vision in a pioneering [clinical trial] (https://classic.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04278131). I also explore computer vision applications of the neural code in robotics. In addition to my work at Bionic Sight, I like to think about new ways to responsibly leverage the immense capabilities artificial intelligence provides, especially with regards to social and environmental issues we face today. As part of that, I  work with [Greenstand](https://greenstand.org/home) on a variety of machine learning problems in my free time.

Outside of work, I'm a big fan of soccer and basketball and enjoy learning new things about the world, through the arts, travel, or through my family and friends. I certainly enjoy writing- this website contains essays I write periodically about a variety of topics, but I also semi-regularly post creative writing on [my newsletter](https://shubhom.substack.com/).
