# Hello!
Welcome to my site! I'm currently a grad student at Rice University in Houston, Texas researching how artificial intelligence can be used to restore function for pateints with neural disease. Before this, I spent four wonderful years as an engineer at [Bionic Sight](https://www.bionicsightllc.com/) in New York City working on [clinical trial] (https://classic.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04278131) for a optogenetic retinal prosthetic for blind patients.

Outside of work, I'm a big fan of soccer and basketball and enjoy learning new things about the world, through the arts, travel, or through my family and friends. I certainly enjoy writing- this website is a work-in-progress for research related writing, but I also semi-regularly post creative writing on [my newsletter](https://shubhom.substack.com/). 

If you're interested in connecting about anything and everything feel free to reach me at shubhom@rice.edu.
